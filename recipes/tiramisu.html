</p>

<p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3 large eggs with yolks and whites separated (Note: Make sure your crockery is dry as any water will interfere with its ability to form stiff peaks.)</li>
    <li>50g caster sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>250g mascaporne cheese</li>
    <li>5 tbsp kahlua, rum, Bailey's or other alcohol of your choice, or omit if making non-alcoholic version</li>
    <li>At least 30 pieces of savoiardi</li>
    <li>At least 180ml of espresso shots</li>
    <li>Cocoa and sieve for dusting</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat yolks and sugar with an electric beater until the colour of the mixture turns from yellow to pale yellow and the consistency becomes thick. Add vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg whites in a clean and dry bowl till stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Add the cream mixture slowly and in parts to the beaten egg whites and gently fold through, taking care not to bash out all the air in the foam.</li>
        <li>Mix espresso shots and alcohol in a small and shallow dish. Dip the savoiardi and line the bottom of a dish of your choice. You can also use ramekins if you like, to make individual mini portions.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture in Step 3 over this layer of savoiardi evenly. Top with another layer of coffee dipped savoiardi and cover with another layer of mixture from Step 3.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Dust with cocoa powder just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
